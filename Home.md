MiniMap XNA Add-On
Conceptual explanation

A minimap is a small map that gives the player an overview of the entire terrain. In most RTS games, the minimap is located in one of the corners of the screen. The minimap is a great tool which provides a lot of information to the user at a quick glance. This can be information about the terrain, what areas are visible, troop movements, and much more. The minimap can also incorporate strategic locations, area ownership, areas of influence, and other tools to help the game player. [2](2)
